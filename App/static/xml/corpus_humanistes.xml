               <p> The Pope's advocates have been the Pope's worst friends, and the extravagant
                  Lutherans have most hurt <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>. I would have
                  held aloof had it been possible. I am no judge of other men's consciences or
                  master of other men's beliefs. There are actors enough on the stage, and none can
                  say how all will end. I do not object generally to the evangelical doctrines, but
                  there is much in <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>'s teaching which I
                  dislike. He rims everything which he touches into extravagance. True, Christendom
                  is corrupt and needs the rod, but it would be better, in my opinion, if we could
                  have the Pope and the princes on our side. <persName ref="#Campegio">Campegio</persName> was gentle enough, but could
                  do nothing. Clement was not opposed to reform, but when I urged that we should
                  meet him half-way nobody listened. The violent party carries all before it. They
                  tear the hoods off monks who might as well have been left in their cells. Priests
                  are married, and images are torn down. I would have had religion purified without
                  destroying authority. Licence need not be given to sin. Practices grown corrupt by
                  long usage might be gradually corrected without throwing everything into
                  confusion. <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> sees certain things to be
                  wrong, and in flying blindly at them causes more harm than he cures. Order human
                  things as you will, there will still be faults enough, and there are remedies
                  worse than the disease. Is it so great a thing to have removed images and changed
                  the canon of the mass ? What good is done by telling foolish lads that the Pope is
                  Antichrist, that confession carries the plague, that they cannot do right if they
                  try, that good works and merits are a vain imagination, that free will is an
                  illusion, that all things hold together by necessity, and that man can do nothing
                  of himself? Such things are said. You will tell me that <persName ref="#Luther"
                     >Luther</persName> does not say them — that only idiots say them. Yes, but
                  Luther encourages men who say them, and if I had a contract to make I would rather
                  deal with a Papist than with some evangelicals that I have known. It is not always
                  safe to remove the Camarinas of this world, and <persName ref="#Platon"
                     >Plato</persName> says you cannot guide the multitude with- out deceiving them.
                  Christians must not lie, but they need not tell the whole truth. Would that
                     <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> had tried as hard to improve popes
                  and princes as to expose their faults. He speaks bitterly of me. He may say what
                  he pleases. <persName ref="#Karlstadt">Carlstadt</persName> has been here. He has
                  published a book in German maintaining that the Eucharist is only a sign. All

               <p> You are anxious that <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> shall answer me
                  with moderation. Unless he writes in his own style, the world will say we are in
                  connivance. Do not fear that I shall oppose evangelical truth. I left many faults
                  in him unnoticed lest I should injure the Gospel. I hope mankind will be the
                  better for the acrid medicines with which he has dosed them. Perhaps we needed a
                  surgeon who would use knife and cautery. <persName ref="#Karlstadt"
                     >Carlstadt</persName> and he are going so fast that <persName ref="Luther"
                     >Luther</persName> himself may Come to regret popes and bishops. His genius is

            <body>
               <p>When <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> first spoke the whole world
                  applauded, and your Highness among the rest. Divines who are now his bitterest
                  opponents were then on his side. Cardinals, even monks, encouraged him. He had
                  taken up an excellent cause. He was attacking practices which every honest man
                  condemned, and contending with a set of harpies, under whose tyranny Christendom
                  was groaning. Who could then dream how far the movement would go ? Had
                  <!--Daniel--> foretold it to me, I would not have believed him. <persName
                     ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> himself never expected to produce such an
                  effect. After his Theses had come out I persuaded him to go no further. I doubted
                  if he had learning enough. I was afraid of riots. I urged the printers to set in
                  type no more books of his. He wrote to me. I cautioned him to be moderate. The
                  Emperor was then well inclined to him. He had no enemies save a few monks and
                  papal commissioners, whose trade he had spoilt. These people, fools that they
                  were, kindled a fire, and it was then said to be all my fault — I ought to have
                  silenced <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> ! I thought no one could be
                  less fit. My old enemies took up the cry, and told the Emperor that I was the
                  person to do it. They only wanted to throw me among the wolves. What <!--coiJd--> I have
                  done ? They required me to revoke what I had said at first in <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>'s favour. A
                  pretty condition! I was to lie against my own soul, make myself the hangman of a
                  set of prostitute wretches, and draw the hatred on myself of all <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>'s
                  supporters. I have or had some popularity in Europe. I should have lost it all,
                  and have been left naked to be torn in pieces by the wild beasts. You say the
                  Emperor and the Pope will stand up for me. How can the Emperor and the Pope help
                  me when they can hardly help themselves? To call on me to put myself forward is to
                  saddle an ox or overload a broken-down horse. I am to sacrifice myself for tte
                  Catholic Faith! It is not for everyone to uphold the Ark. Even Jerome, when he
                  attacks heresy, becomes almost a heretic. I do it ! Are there no bishops, no
                  college dignitaries, no hosts of divines? Surely among so many there were fitter
                  persons than I. Some really tried. Great persons declared war. The Pope put out a
                  Bull, the Emperor put out an edict, and there were prisons, faggots, and burnings.
                  Yet all was in vain. The mischief only grew. What could a pigmy like <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> do
                  against a champion who had beaten so many giants? There were men of intellect on
                  <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>'s side to whom I had looked up with respect. I wondered what they found in
                  him to impress them ; but so it was. I thought I must be growing blind. I did see,
                  however, that the world was besotted with ritual. Scandalous monks were ensnaring
                  and strangling consciences. Theology had become sophistry. Dogmatism had grown to
                  madness, and, besides, there were the unspeakable priests, and bishops, and Roman
                  officials. Perhaps I thought that such disorders required the surgeon, and that
                  God was using <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> as he used Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar. <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> could not have
                  succeeded so signally if God had not been with him, especially when he had such a
                  crew of admirers behind him. I considered that it was a case for compromise and
                  agreement. Had I been at Worms, I believe I could have brought it to that. The
                  Emperor was not imwilling. Adrian, Clement, Campegio have not been unwilling. The
                  difficulty lay elsewhere. <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>'s patrons were stubborn and would not yield a
                  step. The Catholic divines breathed only fire and fury. If that was to be the way,
                  there was no need of me. I conceived, moreover, that if it was fit and right to
                  burn a man for contradicting articles decreed by the Church, there was no law to
                  burn him for holding mistaken opinions on other subjects, as long as he defended
                  them quietly and was otherwise of blameless life. The Paris divines do not think
                  on the papal power as the Italian divines think, but they do not burn each other.
                  Thomists and Scotists differ, but they can work in the same schools. Stakes and
                  prisons are vulgar remedies. Two poor creatures have been burnt at Brussels, and
                  the whole city has turned Lutheran. If the infection had touched only a few it
                  might be stamped out, but it has gone so far that kings may catch it. I do not say
                  let it alone, but do not make it worse by bad treatment. Fear will alter nothing,
                  and spasmodic severity exasperates. If you put the fire out by force, it will
                  burst up again. I trust, I hope that <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> will make a few concessions and that
                  Pope and princes may still consent to peace.</p>
               <p> May Christ's dove come among us, or else Minerva's owl. <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> has administered
                  an acrid dose to a diseased body. God grant it prove salutary. Your Highness would
                  not have written as you have done if you knew all that I could tell you. The Pope,
                  the Emperor, his brother Ferdinand, the King of England wrote to me in a far
                  different tone. Your freedom does not offend me. It rises only out of your zeal
                  for the Faith. I risked the loss of my best friends by refusing to join Luther,
                  but I did not break off my connection with them because they did join him, and
                  Adrian and Campegio, and the <persName ref="Henry8">King of <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName></persName>, and the Cardinal of York all say
                  that I did right. I vex <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> more by continuing my intimacy with them than I
                  could do with the most violent abuse. The eager Catholics were disappointed, of
                  course, with <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName>'s "Free "Will." The mountain had brought forth a mouse. If
                  that was all that he could do, he might as well have held his peace. The Prince of
                  Carpi wrote to him as Duke George had done, telling him he was still under
                  suspicion of favouring <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>. He answers : — </p>

               <p> When the Lutheran drama opened, and all the world applauded, I advised my friends
                  to stand aloof. I thought it would end in bloodshed, and had I taken a part made
                  enemies of the Swiss and Germans, who had stood by me in the fight for learning.
                  Certain theologians left no stone unturned to drive me to join a party which they
                  expected would be condemned. The Lutherans alternately courted me and menaced me.
                  Tor all this, I do not move a finger's breadth from the teaching of the Roman
                  Church. You would think more of this if you knew the Germans, and what a tempest I
                  could raise if I chose to lead the fray. Instead of leading, I have stood naked
                  and unarmed between the javelins of two angry foes. It is said that Luther has
                  borrowed much from me. He denies it himself and says I do not understand theology.
                  But suppose it is so. Has he borrowed nothing from Augustine and St. Paul ? You
                  ask me why I did not speak out at once. Because I regarded <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> as a good man,
                  raised up by Providence to correct the depravity of the age. Whence have all these
                  troubles risen ? From the audacious and open immorality of the priesthood, from
                  the arrogance of the theologians and the tyranny of the monks. These began the
                  battle by attacking learning. I did not wish to expel the old studies. I wished
                  only to give Greek and Hebrew a place among them which I thought would minister to
                  the glory of Christ. The monks turned the question on points of faith where they
                  thought they would have stronger ground. You remember Eeuchlin. The conflict was
                  raging between the Muses and their enemies, when up sprang Luther, and the object
                  thenceforward was to entangle the friends of literature in the Lutheran business
                  so as to destroy both them and him together. So things have gone on ever since,
                  the clamour growing louder and the spirit of the contest worse. This is the naked
                  fact. If what I hear is true, I must call on your highness to check the slanders
                  spread about me. If I am mistaken, you will pardon my complaints. </p>

               <p> The English friends of <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> were more eager than even the German princes that
                  he should strike again at <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>, and strike in earnest. Beyond all others, <persName ref="#More">Sir
                  Thomas More,</persName> who wished him to silence for ever the charge of having been <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>'s
                  confederate. More had understood and valued the tract upon "Free Will." But it was
                  not enough. He must enlarge his reply and make a final end of <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>. He must do
                  it. No excuse would serve him for deserting the cause of God. </p>

                  which he has darkened Scripture turn to ice at your touch. They were cold enough

               <p>Alas, <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> could not do it. His private thought, which indeed he had spoken

                  and he would not be found fighting against God. He poured out his sorrows and his
                  perplexities in a letter to the Dominican Faber, who, like More, had been urging
                  him to write more fully.</p>

                  have said had I provoked him in earnest? He means his book to live with my crimes
                  embalmed in it. Ten editions of his reply have been published already. The great
                  men in the Church are afraid to touch him, and you want poor me to do it again, me
                  who am too weak to make myself feared, and too little of a saint in my life not to
                  dread what may be said of me. <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> pretends to wish to be friendly, yet he calls

                  Faction spares none, and calumny sticks and cannot be washed off. The grosser the
                  charge the more credit it receives. I wrote my book to please the princes and to
                  show that I was not a Lutheran, but when I pointed out how the mischief was to be
                  met which the monks and theologians were doing, no one listened. I wrote to <persName ref="#AdrianVI">Pope
                  Adrian</persName>. I suppose my letter did not please him, for he took no notice of it, and
                  now you see what has come. In <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName> they are at work with gibbet and dungeon. It
                  won't answer. The other side cry " Liberty ! " and have the printers with them,
                  while the Church has only monks. Epicurean priests, and rabid Divines. The nobles
                  favour the movement with an eye to the churchmen's lands and offices. The princes
                  like to fish in troubled waters and plunder the wrecks which drive ashore. Go on
                  with your stakes and prisons and you will have universal chaos. As yet we are only
                  at the beginning. The <persName ref="#AdrianVI">Pope</persName> has ordered the Italians to be quiet. He is wise. They
                  will look on and chuckle while we cut each other's throats. Why cannot we be wise
                  too ? We are all embarked in the same ship. If the ship sinks, we shall sink with
                  it, and the mischief is spread too widely to be cured by ordinary remedies. The
                  princes, you say, want my opinion. They shall have it if they wish, but it must be
                  kept secret. Ferocious writing ought to be checked on both sides. One is as bad as
                  the other. Preachers and orators should be silenced, and quiet men put in their
                  places who will leave alone dogmas and teach piety and morals. The Catholics are
                  now persecuting innocent men and are driving into <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>'s camp those whom they
                  should most wish to attract. Rage if you will against rebellion, but do not hurt
                  those who have done no harm. Do not close the schools, but see that they have fit
                  masters. The Lutherans are strong in the towns. Bid them tolerate their opponents.
                  Leave each man to his own conscience and put down riots. Let Catholics meanwhile
                  reform the abuses which have provoked the revolt, and leave the rest to a general
                  council. Stir no more hornets' nests, unless you wish to ruin <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName>.</p>

               <p>One more curious letter, without date or address, belongs to the present period,
                  and was probably meant for the <persName ref="#CharlesQuint">Emperor</persName>'s eye.</p>

               <p>Revolution is in the air. I fear bloodshed, for the roots have gone deep. No one
                  who has not seen <placeName ref="#Germany">Germany</placeName> can believe in what condition we are. I cannot leave the
                  Church and join the reformers. But the people are all on their side, in
                  consequence of the raging of the monks, who are working their own ruin. At <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName>
                  all is confusion. Letters cannot enter. It is supposed that <persName ref="#AdrianVI">the Pope</persName> and the
                  <persName ref="#CharlesQuint">Emperor</persName> will be reconciled, and that the <persName ref="#AdrianVI">Pope</persName> will take the <persName ref="#CharlesQuint">Emperor</persName>'s side. In
                  that case there will be no peace. The <persName ref="#AdrianVI">Pope</persName> ought to be indifferent.</p>
               <p>In these later anxious years we have lost sight of V the old brilliant witty
                  <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName>. The times had grown serious, and his humour when it showed was bitter,
                  but the bright nature was still there, and now and then a gleam breaks out among
                  the clouds. The letter to <persName ref="#WWarham">Warham</persName> was sent by the hand of a disciple, <persName ref="#Cann">Nicholas
                  Cann</persName>, who was paying <placeName ref="#Angleterre">England</placeName> a visit. <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> gave him an introduction to the
                  <persName ref="#WWarham">Archbishop</persName>, and a few hints to <persName ref="#Cann">Cann</persName> himself. </p>

               <p>You will enjoy your visit. You will meet many of the English nobles and men of
                  learning. They will be infinitely kind to you, but be careful not to presume upon
                  it : when they condescend, be you modest. Great men do not always mean what their
                  faces promise, so treat them reverendly, as if they were gods. They are generous
                  and will offer you presents, but recollect the proverb. Not everything everywhere
                  and from everyone. Accept gratefully what real friends give you. To mere
                  acquaintances excuse yourself lightly ; more art is needed in refusing graciously
                  than in receiving. An awkward rejection often makes enemies. Imitate the polypus
                  and you have no difficulties. Put out your head, give your right hand, and yield
                  the wall ; smile on as many as you please, but trust only those you know, and be
                  specially careful to find no fault with English things or customs. They are proud
                  of their country, as well they may be. </p>

               <p> So much for the character of our ancestors, which has altered less than one might
                  have expected. <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> had other things to make him anxious, and was soon absorbed
                  again in the German confusions. He seems to have been specially confidential with
                  <persName ref="#GeorgesSaxe">Duke George of Saxony</persName>. </p>

               <p> <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> amazes me. If the spirit which is in him be an evil one, no more fatal
                  monster was ever born. If it be a good spirit, much of the fruit of the Gospel is
                  wanting in him. If a mixed one, how can two spirits so strong exist in the same
                  person ? Intolerable corruptions have crept into Christian life which custom makes
                  appear like virtues, and there are other changes besides which wise men would
                  gladly see if they can be had without a convulsion. This I know to be the opinion
                  of the <persName ref="#CharlesQuint">Emperor</persName>. But nothing will satisfy <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>, and his party is so divided, and
                  their gospel is generating so much licence, that it may fall to pieces, even if
                  the <persName ref="AdrianVI">Pope</persName> and the <persName ref="#CharlesQuint">Emperor</persName> combine. The hope is that the Princes may have influence
                  enough to keep the Lutherans within bounds, or a worse fire may break out on the
                  other side through those wretched monks and divines.</p>

               <p> The folly of the monks and theologians made the real danger. On the same day he
                  writes to another correspondent : —</p>
               <p> Frightful storms spring from small beginnings. The Lutheran cyclone rose out of a
                  trifle. The Dominicans paraded their indulgences too ostentatiously. <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>
                  objected. The Dominicans set up a clamour. I tried to stop them, but could not do
                  it, and you see the result. The <persName ref="#AdrianVI">Pope</persName> should have left matters alone. No one dreads
                  the monks more than the Pope does, and none treat the <persName ref="#AdrianVI">Pope</persName> with more contempt than
                  the monks do when it suits their purpose.</p>


               <p> Invariably <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> speaks of the monks as the cause of all that had happened. His
                  especial bitterness was due, perhaps, to his early experience ; and undoubtedly
                  they returned his hatred. They had been forbidden to abuse him in their pulpits.
                  They were working underground to prevent the circulation of his books and induce
                  the Church to censure them. <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName>'s writings, being chiefly in German, were
                  unread save where German was spoken. The writings of Erasmus had spread over
                  Europe. His controversy with <persName ref="#Luther">Luther</persName> had not earned his pardon. He was a subject of
                  the Spanish crown ; a party favourable to Mm had begun to grow in the Peninsula,
                  which roused the regulars there to fury. The sacred soil of <placeName ref="#Espagne">Spain</placeName> should at least
                  be kept free from heresy. <persName ref="#Maldonado">Juan Maldonado</persName> writes to him from <placeName ref="#Burgos">Burgos</placeName> :</p>

               <p> The theologians here are working with the monks, and win be counted the only wise
                  ones. They impose on noble ladies with their pretence of holiness. They tell them
                  that they cannot have their sins pardoned unless they go on their knees to some
                  sophisticated friar — only friars, they say, can distinguish the qualities of
                  sins. Not a man, from the meanest potboy to the <persName ref="CharlesQuint">Emperor</persName>, will they count a
                  Christian unless he takes a monk for a director, and many a pretty tale is told by
                  poor women of the shameless doings of these philosophasters. They hate you, but do
                  not you be disturbed. You have torn the masks from their faces, and shown them to
                  the world as they are. I need not say what curses they have imprecated on you.
                  They are now appealing to the bishops and magistrates to prohibit the sale of your
                  books. The hooded masters know well enough the difference between your teaching
                  and their hypocrisy. They know that if your writings are read there will be an end
                  of them. But their abuse does not hurt you. We love you the better for it. A
                  Spanish translation of the " Colloquies " is in the hands of every man and
                  woman.</p>



               <p> The <persName>Emperor</persName> was now himself in <placeName ref="#Spain">Spain</placeName>. The Spanish authorities appealed to him to
                  support them. He had so long corresponded with <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> on the great questions of
                  the day, had seemed so entirely to agree with him, had so peremptorily silenced
                  the attacks upon him in the Low Countries, that <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> looked confidently for a
                  continuance of his countenance ; but it was not without reason that <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> had
                  been alarmed at the possible consequences o£ the capture of <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName> in a change of
                  attitude on <persName ref="#CharlesQuint">Charles</persName>'s part. The <persName ref="#CharlesQuint">Emperor</persName> did, indeed, order the Spanish monks to
                  hold their tongues ; but there were symptoms which <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName>'s friends did not like,
                  and the monks were dangerous.</p>
               <p> Your enemies (wrote another of these friends) are now mute, and dare not crow
                  even on their own dunghills. But they mutter still in private, and I fear the
                  beast with 700 heads may win in the end. You, though long may you live, must die
                  at last ; but a religious order never dies. It has good men in it as well as bad,
                  but good and bad alike stand by their profession, and the worse part drags the
                  better after it.</p>
               <p> A religious order never dies. <persName ref="#CharlesQuint">Charles V</persName> could not just then afford to quarrel
                  with the leaders of the Church in <placeName ref="#Spain">Spain</placeName>. It was necessary for him to pacify the
                  suspicions which had risen out of the imprisonment of the <persName ref="#AdrianVI">Pope</persName>, and though he
                  refused to allow <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName>'s writings to be suppressed, he could not resist a demand
                  that those writings should be examined by the Inquisition. <persName ref="#Erasme">Erasmus</persName> had appealed to
                  him. He replied in a curious letter, half an apology, though in terms of the
                  utmost personal esteem.</p>
